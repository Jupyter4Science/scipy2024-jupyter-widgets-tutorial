    "[`ipyautoui`](https://github.com/maxfordham/ipyautoui), a Python package that provides a simple way to create interactive user interfaces in Jupyter notebooks. It is built on top of Jupyter widgets and Pydantic and provides a higher-level API for creating interactive widgets.  It is particularly well suited for creating settings panels.\n",

    "1. Make a widget from a simple Pydantic model using ipyautoui.\n",
