    "\n",
    "[Voici](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici) is a project in heavy development that aims to provide a way to deploy Jupyter notebooks as standalone web applications.  It is built on top of [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a smaller, browser-based version of the Jupyter notebook environment. JupyterLite (and thus Voici) uses WebAssembly to run a Python interpreter in the browser, and includes a JavaScript kernel for running JavaScript code. Both Voici and JupyterLite are still in the early stages of development so they are still quite buggy.\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLite can only use `no-arch` (OS-independent) Python packages from conda-forge and WebAssembly-based packages from emscripten-forge can be installed.  If you can restrict yourself to those packages, you can try to deploy your notebook as a standalone web application using Voici as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a project directory (in this tutorial, it is called `voici_project`) that will eventually contain:\n",
    "   -  a `webapp` directory containing data, local packages, and the Jupyter notebooks you want to deploy and\n",
    "   -  an `environment.yml` file listing the required Python packages (Example provided in the `voici_project` directory)\n",
    "2. Create the `webapp` subdirectory and place any notebooks and other files you want to deploy it.  In our case copy the `dashboard` and `data` directories as well as the `02d_dashboard_test.ipynb` notebook into `webapp`.\n",
    "3. Create an `environment.yml` file in the project directory.  That file should contain the list of required Python packages similar to the example one provided (remember, packages can only be `no-arch` (OS-independent) Python packages from conda-forge and WebAssembly-based packages from emscripten-forge)."
