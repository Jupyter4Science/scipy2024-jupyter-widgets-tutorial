    "\n",
    "[Voici](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici) is a project that aims to provide a way to deploy Jupyter notebooks as standalone web applications.  It is built on top of [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a smaller, browser-based version of the Jupyter notebook environment. JupyterLite (and thus Voici) uses WebAssembly to run a Python interpreter in the browser, and includes a JavaScript kernel for running JavaScript code. Both Voici and JupyterLite are still in the early stages of development, but is aimed at allowing client-side processing of Jupyter notebooks without requiring the installation of a Jupyter server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming all the dependencies of your notebook are available in the JupyterLite environment, you can try to deploy your notebook as a standalone web application using Voici as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a project directory (in this tutorial, it is called `voici_project`) that will eventually contain:\n",
    "   -  a \"webapp\" directory of Jupyter notebooks you want to deploy and\n",
    "   -  an `environment.yml` file listing the required Python packages (Example provided in the `voici_project` directory)"

    "2. In that project directory:\n",

    "   - Place any notebooks and other files you want to deploy in the \"webapp\" directory.\n",

    "The challenge is during the build process, Voici will try to install WebAssembly versions of the Python packages that have C or rust code from the `emscripten-force` repo. If a package is not available in the WebAssembly format and uses any compiled C or rust code, the build will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Annoying Voici Build Problem**: There is currently a problem in that during the build process `conda` is used to install the packages, and a bug was introduced in the build-process for WebAssembly packages at the `emscripten-force` repo that causes the build to fail with an error that \"'emscripten' is not a valid Platform\". \n",
    "- [This is a known issue](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/issues/3291) and is [being worked on](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/13962).  \n",
    "- If this happens to you, you may will likely need to perform a `conda clean --all` to clear the messed up package metadata that you downloaded. Otherwise any future attempt to `conda install` will fail with a similar error!\n",
    "- The workaround is to install `micromamba` (which is why we include it in the `complexapps-2024` environment) as it doesn't trigger the bug and is automatically selected by `voici build` if installed."
