    "- [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) - a notebook-driven development platform. Simply write notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation, tests, continuous integration, and packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [modular nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/modular_nbdev.html) - makes use of only the most basic features of nbdev. It will allow us take any standalone notebook and turn it into a Python script or module. Modular nbdev will allow us to bridge the gap between messy, exploratory tutorial notebooks and clean, well-organized Python modules that we can import from. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following introduction to \"modular nbdev\" is a much simpler than the full [nbdev tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) because we won't create a continuous integration Python package that can be uploaded to PyPi and/or Anaconda. We will simply use notebooks to create clean Python modules that we can use to build our dashboards and web apps. From here on out, when we mention \"nbdev\", we are really referring to \"modular nbdev.\""

    "While Jupyter notebooks can be exported to a Python file, nbdev allows us to export only some notebook cells, those that we choose, into a Python module. The real benefit of this approach lies in the ability to allow your notebook to tell the story of how your code came into its final form. This programming paradigm where the code provides the documentation for decisions its design is called [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).\n",
