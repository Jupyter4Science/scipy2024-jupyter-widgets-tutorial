    "\n",
    "### Goal of this notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "After doing all this work, we should also review another approach to the entire problem of developing web apps with Python. This approach is called Solara, and it is both a Python library that allows you to create web applications using Python code only and a server to deploy those web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps you will take in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn about *reactive* variables and solara *components*.\n",
    "2. Build a version of our dashboard using solara.\n",
    "3. Briefly discuss how a solara server differs from a voila server.\n",
    "4. Discuss the steps to deploy a solara app on the [ploomber](https://www.platform.ploomber.io/) service.\n"
